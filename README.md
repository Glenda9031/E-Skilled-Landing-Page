# E-Skilled-Landing-Page
 Frontend Mentor HTML/CSS Project
Please assist me in submitting my 2nd solution to Frontend Mentor!

1. I don't have any idea how to display the large icon-desktop image on the page
2. My page is too wide. What should the width be for the page?
3. My colors are not the same as the original.
4. The 'Get Started' links are not lining up.  What can I do to correct this?
5. My 'svg' images are not aligned correctly. How can I correct this?

I'm sure there are more changes that need to be made before I submit a final solution.  I appreciate any advice or suggestions!
